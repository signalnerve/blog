I'm a musician and programmer.

I work as a Developer Advocate for [Cloudflare Workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-workers/), helping developers get up and running with serverless applications. Most of my day-to-day work is focused around making serverless development _easier_, and more _approachable_: a lot of the content on this site, naturally, will be oriented around that work.

I work on a few side projects as well - [Byteconf](https://www.byteconf.com) is a free developer conference series, streamed online, and [Frontend Jobs](https://www.frontendjobs.tech) is a job board for frontend developers.
